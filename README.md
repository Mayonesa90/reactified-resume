#Reactified resume

This is my single page application done with React, using Tailwind for styling and redux f√∂r global state management.

It includes:
- Landing page
- About page
- Portfolio (with repos from GitHub using useEffect and async function)
- Contact (with a contact form using useState)
- Dark mode (using Redux)
