5. How to Use the Project
- When you start up the project you will come to the `Landing page`. Here you can toggle dark-mode with the moon-button and access the content via the navigation.
- The about page is for now only generating a short bio
- The Portfolio is showing my repositories from GitHub with clickable links. It is using a useEffect and an fetch function to get the repositories
- Contact has a form that only console.log's the data input for now, it is using useState to set the data
